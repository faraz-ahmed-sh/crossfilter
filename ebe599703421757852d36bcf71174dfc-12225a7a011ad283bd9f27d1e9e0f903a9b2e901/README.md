This is an updated version of [this demo](http://crossfilter.github.io/crossfilter/) of the crossfilter library. Crossfilter has been one of my favorite - and what I think to be on of the most underrated - JavaScript libraries. It hasn't seen much of any updates in quite a while, so I wanted to find out how it would work with version 4 of d3.js.

There were some issues that came up with how d3-brush has been [updated for v4](https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/master/CHANGES.md#brushes-d3-brush). Big thanks goes to Alastair Dant ([@ajdant](https://twitter.com/ajdant)) for helping to figure out a couple of those issues! 

Also worth reading, is [this discussion](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/issues/1316) started by
